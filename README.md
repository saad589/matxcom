MATXCOM is a specialized program developed for the calculation of x-ray and gamma-ray interaction cross-sections and attenuation parameters for arbitrary materials. Based on the EPICS2023 evaluated photon data library (EPDL), MATXCOM calculates the following properties:
- Mass attenuation coefficient (MAC)
- Linear attenuation coefficient (LAC)
- Half and tenth value layers (HVL and TVL)
- Mean free path (MFP)
- Total atomic and electronic cross-sections (ACS and ECS)
- Effective atomic number (Z<sub>eff</sub>)
- Effective electron density (N<sub>eff</sub>)
- Effective conductivity (C<sub>eff</sub>)
- Energy absorption and exposure buildup factors (EABF and EBF)
